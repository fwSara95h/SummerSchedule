### Explanation of How `index.html` is Generated by `create_html.py`:

1. **Reading JSON Data**: The script begins by loading the class data from `classes.json` using the `json` module.
   
2. **HTML Template**: It takes the HTML structure `html_template`, which contains placeholders for dynamically inserting the schedule the table and related CSS colors into the `style` section.

3. **Time Slots and Days**: It defines the time slots from 8:00 to 16:30 and the days of the week.

4. **Schedule Rows Construction**:
    - It iterates over each time slot and day.
    - For each slot, it checks if a class starts at that time. If it does, it inserts a table cell (`<td>`) with the appropriate `rowspan` based on the class duration and adds class-specific styling.
    - If no class starts at that specific time but occurs during the slot, it skips adding a new cell due to the `rowspan` handling. If there's no class-related activity at that time, it adds an empty cell (`<td></td>`).

5. **Integration and Output**: Finally, the constructed schedule rows are integrated into the HTML template by replacing the `<!--SCHEDULE_ROWS-->` placeholder. The complete HTML content is then written to an output file (`index.html`).

In summary, the script effectively automates the generation of a weekly schedule HTML document from JSON data, handling different class times and durations correctly. Each class is displayed in its respective time slot with the appropriate color and information, based on the class details provided in the JSON file.
